      I am going to tell the truth about my

      <h2 class="pixel-text section-title">1. Manipulation</h2>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        He threatened to delete my Discord account if I speak out loud that he falsely reports my YouTube channel without giving a reason.
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        I said: <span class="green-text">Skibidi toilet famun tax rizz Ohio hawk tuah Livvy dune duke dennis skull emoji nerd emoji quandale dingle thick of it i like my cheese drippy bruh</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        He replied: <span class="red-text">Shite joke</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        This all started with a build-up of an argument on <span class="yellow-text">SnapChat</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="pixel-text section-title">2. Says the N-Word to wind me up</h2>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        I posted <span class="red-text">"what is deleted now"</span>, a Reddit vent of my <span class="red-text">Older Brother</span> in r/EntitledPeople. He will literally say the N-Word to make me upset or provoke me.
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        Things got so bad that I had to record it on <span class="light-red-text">Voice Memos</span>. He would tell me to delete it permanently and make me let him check <span class="light-red-text">Recently Deleted</span>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="pixel-text section-title">3. Forcing me to delete the messages on SnapChat to silence me and hide the proof</h2>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        SnapChat shouldn't add "A Person Screenshotted This Message" on here because it adds another layer of stress. I had to screenshot it, but my big brother told me to delete the SnapChat messages, and he would LITERALLY threaten to text my mom if I don't delete it.
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        He would also make me let him check <span class="light-red-text">Recently Deleted</span> and <span class="light-red-text">Hidden</span> as well. Here are the exact messages as follows:
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        <span class="red-text">My Older Brother:</span> I'm reporting your YouTube channel<br>
        <span class="green-text">Me:</span> Exposing u for unfair reports<br>
        <span class="red-text">My Older Brother:</span> Idc<br>
        <span class="red-text">My Older Brother:</span> If you expose me I'm deleting ur discord
      </p>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        See? He literally said that he reported my YouTube channel without telling me the reason why.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="pixel-text section-title">Final: Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="pixel-text">
        I would finally expose him in a document after staying silent about this and holding it in a lot for a while. In my opinion, this kind of thing shouldn't just slide by, it should be called out immediately. Just a reminder that he is 16 and his race is white. Not trying to be a racist though.
